Article Manager is an open-source read-it-later application. 

I needed a simple way to track articles I read, add notes, and get basic insights on my reading habits. 

Existing tools felt too heavy or were missing features, so I built my own and I've been using it weekly ever since.

## Features

- Secure authentication (JWT + httpOnly cookies + CSRF)
- Create, edit, delete, and list articles scoped to the current user.
- Track article metadata: title, author, URL, year, summary, tags, consulted, read-later, and liked flags.
- Browse read-later and liked articles.
- View stats for top authors and articles read by month.
- Toggle light and dark themes.


## Architecture

The application is built with a Flask REST API, a PostgreSQL database and a React interface. It supports user accounts, article metadata, liked and read-later flags, a consulted flag, and basic statistics such as top authors and articles consulted by month.

Authentication uses JWTs stored in httpOnly cookies, as well as CSRF tokens for authenticated requests.

The project includes automated checks for both frontend and backend code through GitHub Actions.


| Layer    | Technology      | Why?                                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | React 18 | To have a dynamic UI and fast interactions when browsing and filtering articles                      |
| Backend  | Flask 3 | To have a lightweight API, easy to extend                                                             |
| Database | PostgreSQL | A relational database that works cleanly with SQLAlchemy and SQL                                   |
| Tooling  | Pytest, Ruff, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Husky | Automated tests, linting, and formatting for fast feedback      |


## Technical Decisions
For the record, here's the justification for some technical decisions I made during the development:
- The app was first developed using Django and MySQL.
- Migrated from Django to Flask after realizing a simpler framework could work just fine with the features I wanted.
- Migrated from MySQL to PostgreSQL as the latter is extremely common on PaaS and was easier to deploy.
- Added an auth layer and per-user data isolation so users can only access and modify their own saved articles.
- The global state of the React interface was first managed through Redux. When I added TanStack Query to cache requests, I realized I could use it to manage most of the data globally and the remaining data (theme+connected status) could be managed through a simple context.
- Moved from storing tokens in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS attacks) to storing them in cookies with a CSRF protection.
- Deployed frontend on Vercel and backend on Render as the free tier was covering my needs and the setup was easy.
- Decided to handle backend cold starts with a simple /health endpoint on the server and add user feedback to avoid confusion.
- Added Alembic to handle schema migrations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 and pip
- Node.js 22 and npm
- PostgreSQL database


## Getting Started

### Backend (`backend/`)

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`:

```
SECRET_KEY=change-me
JWT_SECRET_KEY=change-me
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://user:password@localhost:5432/article_manager
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

Start the Flask API:

```bash
python src/main.py
```


### Frontend (`frontend/`)

To run the frontend, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. 

## Checks

Run backend checks:

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

Run frontend checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
